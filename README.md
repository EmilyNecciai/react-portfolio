## Installation 

> If you are a Coding Bootcamp student and plan to use this repo to build your own react portfolio, please give credit. They will find out that you used someone else's repo instead of building it yourself. Then, they'll fail you or kick you out of the program. I'm happy that you want to use my repo and I love all things open source, but I don't want people to fail a course because they chose to copy what is actually a pretty easy project compared to the rest of what you typically do in a full stack bootcamp. Submit an [issue](https://github.com/EmilyNecciai/react-portfolio/issues) if you have any questions. 

To install this project into your own, use `git clone <REPONAME>` in your command-line, then `npm init` to install the listed dependencies.

### Set Up Form / Contact Submission

Then, create a (free) [Formspree Account](https://formspree.io) to collect and manage your contact submissions. Create a `.env` file and paste in `REACT_APP_FORM_ID="not-a-real-form-id"`. Then, replace `not-a-real-form-id` with the form id listed in your Formspree account (the last part of your form's endpoint: `https://formspree.io/f/not-a-real-form-id`). If you're using something other than Github Pages, such as Vercel, Heroku, or Netlify, set up these variables in that provider's UI/dashboard. 

## Usage 

To use this repo, go to the cloned files, then type `npm start` in your command-line. Be sure you’re in the correct location in your command-line/terminal first! Be sure you're also set up to run a react app!

> Remember to [set up your Formspree Account to collect contact information](#set-up-form--contact-submission)!
